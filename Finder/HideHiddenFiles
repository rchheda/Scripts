What are hidden files?
- Files which start with a '.', for example .emacs or the
.bashrc. These are files that the system doesnt want you to fiddle
around with everyday.

Now have hidden files in the Finder can be pretty cumbersome. To hide
them you will need to do the following:


- Your Mac needs to have the Automator Application (which most Mac's
  have by default, but just double checking)
- Make a folder called Scripts
- Unzip this file in that folder.
- Open your Spotlight in your Mac and search for "ShowHiddenFiles"
- Hit enter 
- Open a Finder window to check if hidden files are still visible

Its that simple to make hiding of hidden files now in the Mac.
Let me know of any bugs or issue, would love some feedback.
