I know I've uploaded it as a .zip file. Which means half of you'll
will not trust it and not download it and unzip it thinking its some
virus from the internet. I know I wouldn't, but for the other half of
you, this is what you'll need to do:

- Your Mac needs to have the Automator Application (which most Mac's
  have by default, but just double checking)
- Make a folder called Scripts
- Unzip this file in that folder.
- Open your Spotlight in your Mac and search for "ShowHiddenFiles"
- Hit enter 


Its that simple to make showing of hidden files now in the Mac.
Let me know of any bugs or issue, would love some feedback.
