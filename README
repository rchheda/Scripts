This is a trial project containing scripts for everyday things like 
 - Showing Hidden Files in the Finder
 - Hiding Hidden Files in the Finder

These scripts are meant to be run through the Spotlight, so that you
search for them and hit enter and the Mac automatically executes them
for you. 

I am also looking into ways faster than that to execute some of these
things. 

I am also trying to include scripts useful on Windows. I hope to
someday have a full fledged library of scripts, so that every task is
a click away. With all the time that we save, we can go snowboarding
or hiking !!
